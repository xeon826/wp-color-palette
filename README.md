This is a simple WordPress plugin that creates a settings page. The settings page allows WordPress admin users to add their settings for a plugin. 

You can use this skeleton to add a settings page to your plugin. This plugin does the following:
- Adds an admin menu item to the left sidebar in the WordPress admin dashboard along with a submenu item including your settings page
- Creates a settings page that includes a form
- Saves that form to the database
- Makes sure the settings form fields are pre-populated if it has already been filled out

Check out our [blog post](https://blog.wplauncher.com/create-wordpress-plugin-settings-page/) to get step by step instructions on [how to add a settings page to your WordPress plugin](https://blog.wplauncher.com/create-wordpress-plugin-settings-page/). The Settings Page plugin is using the [WordPress Plugin Boilerplate framework](https://github.com/DevinVinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate) and we used [WWPB.me](https://wppb.me/) to generate a version with the settings-page namespaces.
